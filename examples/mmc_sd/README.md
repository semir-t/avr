# MMC/SD Card drive

Low level MMC/SD card drive.

## About
This is a easily portable low level MMC/SD card drive. Current version supports MMC and SDv1 cards, but only MMC was properly tested so there is no guarantee for SDv1 cards. This library contains basic functions for initialization of the MMC/SD card, and for reading/writing data to 512B sectors.

This library, with minor modifications, can be used as a core drive for Elm Chans [FatFS](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html)
